### About Gustavo
My name is Gustavo Gomes, I'm 18 years old, and for a large part of my adolescence, I was a professional basketball player, developing fundamental skills for the sport, such as teamwork, resilience, and discipline.

However, the field of technology has always been a passion in my life, and at a certain point, I decided to pursue this path.

I started delving into programming and began my journey in a Full Stack Python Developer course, and since then, I have felt extremely motivated.

Considering the great success of this transition, my goal is to specialize in Full Stack development.

At this moment, I possess skills in technologies related to Front-end.
